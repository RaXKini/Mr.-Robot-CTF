**General Description by the Author:** <br />
Hello There Folks! I'm Rahul Kini, an aspiring **Cyber Security Engineer** and an **Ethical Hacker**. I have attempted the Mr. Robot CTF developed by Leon Johnson for fun and to gain some knowledge and experience in **Penetration Testing** and **Privilege Escalation**. I have tried my best to design this **HACK REPORT + WALKTHROUGH** thematic, as I'm a huge fan of the TV Show Mr. Robot directed by Sam Esmail. The folks who've watched or watching it yet are going to enjoy the report as my creativity and presentation/reporting skills are put into action here. The folks might as well relate to the TV Show via this report. <br />
